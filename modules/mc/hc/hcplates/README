Routines for calculating plate velocities based on mantle flow, given pre-existing plate configurations.
From the fortran routines of Lithgow-Bertelloni. C written by O'Neill.
contact coneill@els.mq.edu.au with any queries.
 
To compile the code type
	make all

The essential data files are: 
	-enes (contains no. plates, and no, boundary points on each plate)
	-data (contains plate boundary info described by enes)
	-point.j (contains the load data, ie. internal density anomalies).

All other data can be created by the routines.

The programs provided are
	hc_findplate - create a plates id file containing plate id info for each lat/long
	hc_ptrot - calculate unit rotation coefficients for use in calculating plate vels (see CRLB's papers for details)
	hcplates - calculates stage poles and surface lat/long velocity fields based flow from internal density anomalies

Try running run_examples.mk to see if they are working ok, and for an examples on parameter usage.
Use the -h option for details on input parameters (eg. hcplates -h)

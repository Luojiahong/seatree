To automatically configure hc from within SEATREE, run
the configure script from the main SEATREE directory, e.g.

/home/walter/becker/progs/src/seatree

this script will generate a Makefile.include file with important settings for hc
which are described in detail in hc's README file in this directory.

In particular, you will have to set an architecture flag, and specify
will also have to set -DUSE_GMT3 if GMT 3 is to be used

Here's an example content of such a Makefile.include for GMT4

ARCH=x86_64
GMTHOME=/usr/geosys/x86_64/GMT4.2.1/
NETCDFHOME=/usr/geosys/x86_64/netcdf-3.6.0-p1/
GGRD_INC_FLAGS = -I$(GMTHOME)/include -I$(NETCDFHOME)/include 
GGRD_LIBS_LINKLINE = -lggrd -lgmt -lpsl -lnetcdf

For detailed instructions on how to compile hc without SEATREE, see the README
file.

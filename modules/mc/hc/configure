echo To automatically configure hc from within SEATREE, run 
echo the configure script from the main SEATREE directory, e.g.
echo 
owd=`pwd`
cd ../../../
pwd
cd $owd
echo 
echo this script will generate a Makefile.include file with important settings for hc
echo which are described in detail in hc\'s README file in this directory. 
echo 
echo In particular, you will have to set an architecture flag, and specify
echo the paths to GMT and Netcdf packages. If you are using GMT version <4.1.2, you 
echo will also have to set  -DUSE_GMT3
echo 
echo Here\'s an example content of such a Makefile.include
echo 
echo "ARCH=x86_64"
echo "GMTHOME=/usr/geosys/x86_64/GMT4.2.1/"
echo "NETCDFHOME=/usr/geosys/x86_64/netcdf-3.6.0-p1/"

echo "GGRD_INC_FLAGS = -I\$(GMTHOME)/include -I\$(NETCDFHOME)/include "
echo "GGRD_LIBS_LINKLINE = -lggrd -lgmt -lpsl -lnetcdf"

echo For detailed instructions on how to compile hc without SEATREE, see the README

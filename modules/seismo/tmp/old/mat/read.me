use calc_matrix_bw_vx


Original comments:

Compile the code to build the matrix with the included Makefile.

use the attached script matrix*.csh to run the program matrix_bw_vx
(matrix_body waves_voxels) and build matrices that will be stored in
the subdirectory matrices/

notice that the matrices are stored efficiently to take advantage of
their sparsity. One file *mat* with the nonzero values of the matrix;
one file *ind* with their column indexes; one file *pnt* with the
number of nonzero entries at each row; and the data vector *vec*.

aniprmc is the reference model: anisotropic PREM with a 2-layer crust,
stored in the classical PREM format (see Anderson and Dziewonski,
1991).

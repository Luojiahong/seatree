* This tests hypoinverse (specifically the g77 version #1.2)
* in a full implementation where the "ini" command is set up
* to read station, crust, correction and calibration files.
* This requires the system environment variable be defined
* to point to a file that includes the commands and files
* to read on startup. For example, put a line like this in
* your .cshrc file:
*   setenv HYPINITFILE /home/calnet/klein/hypfiles/cal2000seed.hyp
*
* To test hypoinverse with this file, type
*   hypg	(run the program, which should identify itself with a greeting)
*   @test-fullNCSN.hyp	(this runs the file you are reading to locate an event)

* Hypoinverse does this part:
ini		(initialize by reading in files as described above)
phs 'test.arc'	(set sample input file, but give you a chance to change it)
typ
typ Now hit return to locate this file, or type in your own file:
typ
phs
typ
fil	(determine the format of the file)
* the #date lines run the system command to show date & time
typ
#date
prt 'test.prt'	(set the test output file names)
sum 'test.sum'
arc 'testout.arc'
loc
#date
typ Now type stop to stop the program:

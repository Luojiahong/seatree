combined f77/g77 version of hypoinverse 2000,  Jan. 2008

NOTES ON VERSION 1.2

This version (hypoinverse 1.2) compiles under both f77 and g77
fortran compilers on Fred Klein's sun-solaris workstation. I'm told by
other programmers that this version works under g77 on linux also, but
I do not have a linux system to test this on.

There are no functional differences between v. 1.2 and v. 1.1, and the
documentation still applies:

ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/klein/hyp2000/docs/hyp2000-1.1.pdf

1) I have three ftp directories of source code,

v.1.2 source code, f77 makefile, & sun-solaris executable:
  ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/klein/hypf 

v.1.2 source code, g77 makefile, & sun-solaris executable:
  ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/klein/hypg 

v.1.11 source code, f77 makefile, & sun-solaris executable:
  ftp://ehzftp.wr.usgs.gov/klein/hyp2000
  
The source code is EXACTLY THE SAME in both f and g directories. The
makefile is the same except one uses f77 and the other g77. Just type
"make hyp", and put the hyp executable where you want it. The g77
executable is a bit smaller than the f77 executable.

The two compilers issue different warnings, but the warnings can be
ignored.  g77 complains about long arrays taking a long time to
compile, but compile time is still only seconds to a minute or two. The
code uses a logical function I wrote called LASK. g77 requires that
LASK be declared logical, and f77 does not. f77 therefore warns that
LASK is declared but not used (as a variable), but these warnings can
be ignored because the name is satisfied at link time.

2) Changes I had to make to compile under both compilers.  The f77
compiler supports the q format specifier, and g77 does not. This
changes mainly how hypoinverse handles shadow and unused phase records,
which it passes through to output without reading. The q specifier
reads the actual length of the input ascii line so it can be written
out exactly as read. Now the code writes out the non-blank length of
the record, which may be shorter than input.

There were other minor changes of v 1.2 from 1.11 because g77 requires
cetain variables be explicitly declared, but f77 was more forgiving.

3) I am not a guru at all, but I had to do this on my system to compile
with g77. I would suggest just trying to compile and run hyp on your
computer, and the compiler may find all it needs. If it misses a
library, then try this.

I had to put two runtime libraries in a path where g77 could find them 
on my particular system. Run this once (as super user) on your system 
before compiling:

cd /usr/lib
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libg2c.so.0.0.0 libg2c.so.0
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 libgcc_s.so.1

Then as yourself, to make your own executable:

  make hyp

should do it. I compiled with the -Bstatic option, so the runtime fortran
libraries should be bound into the executable.

4) There are some test files. Both hyp2000f and hyp2000g directories have a subdirectory called testsimple, with one earthquake, one station file, one crust model, and no extra correction or delay files. Both locations are identical. This makes me suspicious that I ran the same program twice, but I now think the two compilers produce a program that gives identical results on the same computer.

To test the program, cd to testsimple, run hyp, and type @test2000.hyp to run the sample command file test2000.hyp. 

If you have a full NCSN set of files set up, you can make a fuller test by running test-fullNCSN.hyp. Additional test files are in hyp2000/test and hyp2000/test3, but these were run with version 1.11.

This procedure tests hypoinverse to be sure it can do all the NCSN functions,
but requires that you have all the station, etc. files. Also, these station
files change and are updated from time to time, so your results may not
exactly be reproducible compared to the output file supplied here.

For what its worth, I got this output on my system:

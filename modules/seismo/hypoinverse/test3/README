This test3 directory contains all the files needed to locate a small
set of earthquakes gathered in 2/2007 by the NCSN-USGS earthworm
system. This includes station, crust models and delay files, magnitude
correction and gain files, and a sample earthquake file. The earthquake
file is in hypoinverse archive format, and has already been located by
hypoinverse inside the earthworm system. The calculated fields have
already been filled in the input archive file, but hypoinverse
recalculates everything.

To locate the test file, just type the following:

hyp2000				Run the program
@caltest.hyp			Read and run the hypoinverse command file
loc				Locate the earthquakes
sto				Stop and exit from hypoinverse

Here is the output from the sun terminal:
